<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
<p>
<u>Data collection for tailored candidate promotion. Opportunity for politicians.</u><br>
This is when internet user's data is collected through things like cookies so that politicians can target individual’s interests. Tailoring what they represent for each person, pretending they are the politician they desire in power. Although cookies nowadays are usually used for targeted ads, this is still an opportunity for politicians to help gain votes that may be used in the future or may even already be being used without our knowledge. We will talk about how this is also a risk further on. For now, here’s a quote from mused Aristotle’s CEO, John Aristotle Phillips giving an example of how users information could be used to obtain more votes. “I can see how people with a fishing license might be more interested in clean water and park space. The more information you have that allows you to message to voters with particular interests, the more likely your message is to be well-received.”

<br>
<u>Citizen mobilization.</u><br>
Citizen mobilization can also be used as an opportunity by citizens seeking change due to the large protests that can be generated via the internet and social media. Researcher/journalist Zeynap Tufekci pointed out that the 1963 march on Washington took nine months of planning to get 250,000 people (about half the population of Wyoming) to Washington. Compare this to the few Facebook posts and comparably low effort that managed to bring in 3.5 million people (about twice the population of Nebraska) from all over the world to the women’s march in January 2017. Although the purpose of a protest can be questionable, this protest was peaceful and therefore serves as a safe example of how the internet opens opportunities for large scale communication and coordination which can lead to citizen mobilization for action against potentially corrupt governments. There is another example from 1994 where social media was able to generate worldwide sympathy and action towards the land rights of Zapatistas (indigenous native rural peasants) in Mexico. Resulting in agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.
<br>
<u>Meme warfare.</u><br>
Meme warfare, otherwise known as “memetic warfare,” is a new way politicians use information to influence the public or take down their opponents. Memetic warfare is an information warfare of sorts which is occurring constantly between politicians and the people. Even during the 2016 elections, the Russians had made fake social media accounts and started spreading various memes to influence the outcome of the election (Ascott, 2020). The way these memes particularly are used is interesting, considering they spread disinformation or warped information, which is not true, but does feel like it would be true. Memetic warfare has been used by governments and have been suggested by USA military to have a department on its own, it is explained that memes have applications in psychology as well to a certain extent.
<br>
<br>
Here is a clear example of a meme being used to try and take a politician down.
