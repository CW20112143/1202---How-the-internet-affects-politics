The internet is a difficult place nowadays before it used to be a massive industrial and technological space. 
But nowadays it is now a harbor of different things and most of the time we don't even know whom we are talking to online.
When it comes to online safety and having space where people can freely have their own opinions and express their thoughts without anyone telling them otherwise.
<br>
<br>
But in today's world, with COVID-19 running rampant across the world and schools and universities moving to online learning, politics have had to adapt to this change to keep polls going.
For example, during the 2020 US Election, the US was as close as it could get to a second American Revolution with Donald J. Trump at the center of it all. The reason being is while the Senate was carrying out former US President Donald Trump's impeachment trial
Trump rallied thousands of followers with a simple Twitter post on January 6th, 2021 at 8:17 am that Twitter post spread like wildfire across all hardline Trump followers, and on that same day at just before 1 pm EST and lasting over 7 and a half hours, Trump Followers stormed the US Capitol building,
a raid that had never been done since the British attack on US troops on August 24th, 1824. All of this caused by a simple Twitter post by a world leader (If he can be called that). 
Stepping away from the Capitol Riot, both Presidential candidates, (former US President) Donald Trump and (Current Sitting President) Joe Biden had a lot to deal with during their campaigns as COVID-19 had a significant impact on political opinion as people were under "Stay-Home" Orders from US Health Officials.
Voting had to happen either via postage or if people were allowed by their state governor, contactless voting, and/or socially distanced voting.
