<div style="width:1250px;height:100px;solid #000;"><h4>The Everchanging Landscape of the Internet </h4>
The internet is a difficult place nowadays before it used to be a massive industrial and technological space. 
But nowadays it is now a harbor of different things and most of the time we don't even know whom we are talking to online.
When it comes to online safety and having space where people can freely have their own opinions and express their thoughts without anyone telling them otherwise.
<br>
<br>
But in today's world, with COVID-19 running rampant across the world and schools and universities moving to online learning, politics have had to adapt to this change to keep polls going.
For example, during the 2020 US Election, the US was as close as it could get to a second American Revolution with Donald J. Trump at the center of it all. The reason being is while the Senate was carrying out former US President Donald Trump's impeachment trial
Trump rallied thousands of followers with a simple Twitter post on January 6th, 2021 at 8:17 am that Twitter post spread like wildfire across all hardline Trump followers, and on that same day at just before 1 pm EST and lasting over 7 and a half hours, Trump Followers stormed the US Capitol building,
a raid that had never been done since the British attack on US troops on August 24th, 1824. All of this caused by a simple Twitter post by a world leader (If he can be called that). 
Stepping away from the Capitol Riot, both Presidential candidates, (former US President) Donald Trump and (Current Sitting President) Joe Biden had a lot to deal with during their campaigns as COVID-19 had a significant impact on political opinion as people were under "Stay-Home" Orders from US Health Officials.
Voting had to happen either via postage or if people were allowed by their state governor, contactless voting, and/or socially distanced voting.

In the 2017 IT Professional New Zealand Code of Ethics, there are 8 Key Codes IT Professionals will practice with: <br>
<br>
1. Good Faith<br>
<br>
2. Integrity<br>
<br>
3. Community-Focus<br>
<br>
4. Skills<br>
<br>
5. Continuous Development<br>
<br>
6. Informed Consent<br>
<br>
7. Managed Conflicts of Interest<br>
<br>
and 8. Competence.<br>
<br>
These 8 codes of the ITP Code of Ethics (ITP meaning IT Professionals) are a part of the Constitute of the Institute of IT Professionals NZ Inc. This ensures all members uphold and follow the guidelines set by the Code of Ethics.<br>
In part 1.5, Section 2 of the IP NZ Code of Ethics, states that " The context of the code is based on 4 key principles that are supported by 4 values (but we will be using only 3).
<br>
<br>
The principles are:<br>
<br>
-	Interests of the Community<br>
<br>
-	Respect for the individual<br>
<br>
-	Interests of the client<br>
<br>
-	Professional Integrity<br>
<br>
This is supported by the values of: <br>
<br>
-	Competence<br>
<br>
-	Truth<br>
<br>
-	Social Justice<br>
<br>
To relate these ethics to the research my group and I have gathered, our chosen topic is related to how the internet can be used to affect politics.
Our chosen technology is the internet. We chose to be quite precise when it came to narrow down our topic as it was too broad and narrowing it would allow our research to be more precise.
The main ethical struggle with this topic is that the internet's wide and open space and its huge reach to people and its ability to be controlled. 
There are no rules when it comes to the internet as there is no such thing as internet police. 
Politicians know this And when it comes to their campaigns, they are at no restriction to use their vast resources to create hundreds of ads via webpage advertisements, Youtube ads, and even random ads that pop up when your playing games.
<br>
<br>
To these politicians, this follows the ITP Code of Ethics however there is one value and a Context of the Tenets of the Code that this debacle breaks, and that is the interests of the community and the respect that ITP's must-do (Section 1.3 of the ITP Code of Ethics).
The community is one of the general matters of the ITP Code of Ethics and it is a focal node of the Code itself.
In section 3.1 of the ITP Code of Ethics, it reads: " "Community", in the context of the Code, refers to all groups in society including members' own workplaces."  
When it comes to the Internet and Politics, it is a hard topic to draw Ethical Issues about it as we live in an age of the Internet and the near-infinite number of ways politicians can promote themselves for government and have more votes. 
For example again. The New Zealand 2020 General Elections. We as kiwis got used to seeing ads from Labor and National throughout the entire election and we even saw billboards all across the country. Also, we never saw any of NZ's politicians use social media as a means of promotion. Nor use it as a means of political advantage. 
This in itself is following the NZ ITP Code of Ethics as it applies New Zealand only.
<br>
<br>
However, in the US during the 2016 US Presidential Election, we saw one man use social media and the internet as a means to win.<br>
In 2016, the US Presidential Election was tampered with by Russian hackers in the US. According to an article made in 2019 by Time Magazine, their investigation found that the Russian hackers used the internet-based team for Hilary Clinton to hack her and dmage Clinton's Campaign.
These hackers also spread propaganda for Trump and promoted Trump to more and more people over Clinton. The CIA and FBI also told Times Magazine that during the 2016 Election, Russia stole hundreds of thousands of voter's personal info across all US States. Trump also wanted all his compeditors in his political party to be targeted as well.
Thus these Russian hackers target Marco Rubio as well plummeting his chances to be chosen as a candidate. These cc-ordinated attacks were only found out a year after the election and this landed Trump in very hot water. 
<br>
<br>
To close, if we were to apply this to the NZ ITP Code of Ethics, I myself would say that that in iteslf is impossible as we can not use NZ Codes of Ethics and apply it to other countries like the US.
Using this research from both my team and my own, I see how politics can be influenced by the internet via propaganda and flase info. I have also recognized that we cannot control it. The internet as I mentioned at the beginning is a vast, open space where there can be a near infinite amount of opportunities, but we as users are the ones who make the choices
to pursue those opportunities but these opportunities come with risks, and it is up to us if we are to sacrifice either our saftey and/or our lives to do it.
