<p>When talking about software engineering and the ethics behind a technological creation, it’s important to bring up the Software Engineering code (ACM Ethics). In summary, this code talks about 8 main principles that all software engineers should adhere to.<br>
1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.<br>
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.<br>
3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.<br>
4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.<br>
5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.<br>
6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.<br>
7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.<br>
8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.<br>
It’s important that I tell you about these principles now as I go through many of the opportunities and risks to consider when choosing to take action against E-democracy or not.<br>
The internet has become a part of life, but it’s also a double-edged sword. The internets affects on politics (E-democracy) comes with many flaws. For example: once someone posts something on the internet, it's out there forever and can be seen, used and shared by anyone and everyone. Even if you regret it later and delete it, someone could of taken a picture of it. In which case, it's now out of your hands. This can be a good thing and an opportunity, as a way of holding people like politicians accountable for stuff they say on the internet. However in most cases I believe it's not. What someone does or say could have been private, misinterpreted, taken out of context, or a typo which can lead to unfair or blown out of proportion judgement. Furthermore, the type of person someone was when they posted something on the internet will likely differ to who they are if and when it’s reposted. The deleted post could have also been created during a low point of that persons life; we all make mistakes but our mistakes do not represent us as a whole. This has a large effect on politicians as anything a politician says on the internet can be used against them, in a lot of cases by other politicians. Or on the bright side, it could be an opportunity for others to hold them accountable for what they say or contradict what they claim to represent. Hence it being a double-edged sword. Regardless, as a result of this aspect of the internet there is a risk involved whenever politicians post something on the internet. 
<br>
<br>
The anonymity offered by the internet is also a double-edged sword, because it give people the opportunity to speak out unpopular opinions they may be too scared to say, but also means people can get away with doing bad things on the internet under the anonymity it offers. Which makes private use of the internet risky for society as unknown people can’t be hold accountable for their actions.
<br>
<br>
The extreme spread of information over the internet and its global reach are also a double-edged sword. The fact that we can have such large scale many to many communication over the whole world is great for getting facts and everyone’s opinion out into the world. In fact, this rapid global communication has become almost a necessity to modern day civilisation. I also see this as a very important aspect of modern day politics as without it, you'd only hear the ideas of people and politicians from nearby. Keeping you blind to the knowledge of most others and causing you to likely vote based merely on who was able to reach you. Not everyone can afford to travel the country to get their message across. This makes the internet a huge opportunity for those who don’t have the time or money to travel, for politicians and civilians who have something to say. This also comes with a risk however, as the internet also allows information that shouldn’t be spread to spread so much faster.
<br>
<br>
One example of information you wouldn’t want to risk spreading faster is fake news, aka false information. However it is very common in both politics and on the internet. It’s common for people to try and dismantle opposing viewpoints using fake news, whether it be exaggerated, misguided, out of context or just a blatant lie. The phrase can also be used as an example of fake news by itself, by trying to dismantle true information by falsely claiming it to be false. Not only is fake news information you wouldn’t want to benefit from the internets fast and global reach, but it benefits more from the internets fast and global reach than true information, as in our research you we talk about how fake news spreads faster than true stories. I believe this is a result of people valuing interesting stories that they agree with rather than likely less interesting true stories that may not align with what the believe with. It’s also very time consuming trying to verify everything you see on the internet and the idea that this information could be false doesn’t cross a lot of peoples minds. Regardless, they may fight the idea of it being false, and convince themselves it’s true if it supports what they believe in. 
<br>
<br>
The internet also has another dangerous effect when it comes to fake news through the form of things called filter bubbles and echo chambers. Filter bubbles are algorithms or circumstances that filter out other peoples opinions and increases the chances of them seeing fake news that they want to see, and hence share it with others on the internet. An example of a filter bubble is Facebooks algorithms that show their users contents they know they want to see in order to keep them engaged with their platform. Echo chambers are circumstances on the internet that keep you isolated from other peoples opinions. Like how a Facebook group chat or the people you follow on the internet are likely those that already have the same or similar opinions as you. So as you can see, fake news is a risk you would have to take for account when considering whether to keep E-democracy or fight it.
<br>
<br>
The fast and global spread of information provided by the internet also contributes to citizen mobilization. This gives citizens the opportunity to organize large protests with little effort and time. Evident in the women’s march mentioned in the scholarly E-book “Computers and Society : Modern Perspectives” by Baecker, R. B. on page 144. This is also risky as citizen mobilization, when used irresponsibly, can cause chaos. A recent example of this is the raid on the white house in January 2021.
<br>
<br>
The ability to collect users data is also another opportunity offered by the internet to politicians who may use this information to generate tailored ads, that use individuals interests to try and get them to vote for the politicians, who may automate this process, so it can work at a large scale via computer algorithms. This is also an example of a risk of E-democracy as this tactic is seen as deceitful and not fair play, since you’re potentially pretending to represent, advocate and be something you’re not. It’s also seen as a breach of privacy as such tactics usually use non transparent methods of collecting this information.
<br>
<br>
This is relevant to the Software Engineering code (ACM Ethics), due to principle 1.05: “Cooperate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern caused by software, its installation, maintenance, support or documentation”. The basic structure of the internet is most commonly believed to be created by Vincent Cerf and Bob Kahn. However, the internet is not owned or governed by anyone. So how would the internets creators cooperate in efforts to address the risks presented by E-democracy despite their lack of power over it. Especially since principle 4 (judgement) talks about valuing humanities values rather than their own interests, yet the value or danger of E-democracy is a subjective thing.
<br>
<br>
Well then there’s an important decision to make. Does the negative affects of the internet outweigh the positive affects when it comes to humanities values. Must we take action against the internet to prevent the risks of E-democracy? With all of the opportunities and risks I mention above, I believe that despite all of the internets negative affects on politics, that modern day democracy would suffer a great fall without it. I also think that the internet and E-democracy says a lot about humanity and serves as an analogy of society itself. Both E-democracy, democracy, the internet and everything on it was created by humans, everything bad you see on the internet was done by a fellow human. So just as much as we harm and exploit each other, at the end of the day we also depend on each other. Just like how modern day society and modern day democracy depends on the internet, despite all the harm it may bring us. That’s why it’s my personal recommendation that we don’t try and restrict the internet and E-democracy, but instead, fight the problems caused by other individuals, like fake news and data collection for deceitful campaigning. Peer reviewed research done by Pew Research Center in 2019 found that most people agree that the internet has a net positive influence on the internet. As only 2 out of the 11 countries surveyed had more people saying that the internet had a net negative influence. This suggests that most countries won’t be fighting E-democracy any time soon.
