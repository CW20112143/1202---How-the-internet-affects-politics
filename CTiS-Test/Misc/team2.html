<h2>The internet has become a part of life, but it’s also a double-edged sword. The internets effects on politics comes with many flaws. 
	For example: once someone posts something on the internet, it's out there forever and can be seen, used and shared by anyone and everyone. 
	Even if you regret it later and delete it, someone could of taken a picture of it. In which case it's out of your hands. 
	This can be a good thing as a way of holding people accountable for stuff they say on the internet. However in most cases I beleive it's not. 
	What someone does or say can be misinterpreted, or typos can lead to misinterpretations of a persons character. Furthermore, the type of person someone was when they 
	posted something on the internet will likely differ to who they are now or who they are when the deleted post is reposted by someone else. The deleted post could have also
	been created during a low point of that persons life; we all make mistakes but our mistakes do not represent us as a whole. Private posts, posts taken out of context, 
	once they're on the internet they're out of the senders hands. As you can see one small post can have a big and everlasting effect. This internet phenomenon is known as 
	the butterfly and domino effects with easily shared information. This has a large effect on politicians as anything a politician says on the internet can be 
	screenshotted and shared. It could be taken out of context and hence used against them unfairly. Or on the bright side it could hold them accountable for what they say or contradict what 
	they claim to represent (which may be different for different targeted groups of people). In all fairness, wanting a politician who never is and never was anything but perfect as you're one and 
	only president/prime minister is fair yet unrealistic. It is seemingly so easy to get dirt/contradictions on other politicians via the internet and many politicians try to get their hands on such dirt 
	in order to increase there chances of winning by attacking their oppositions reputation. You could argue how this a good and bad thing, hence it being a double edged sword. The anonymity offered by the 
	internet is also a double edged sword because it allows people to speak out unpopular opinions they may be to scared to say but also means people can get away with doing bad things on the internet under 
	the anonmity it offers. The extreme spread of information over the internet is a also a double edged sword, the fact that we can have such large scale many to many communication over the whole world is 
	great for getting facts and everyones opinion out into the world. Infact, this has become almost a nessecity to modern day civilisation. I also see this as a very important aspect of modern day politics 
	as without it, you'd only hear the ideas of people and politicians from nearby. Keeping you blind to the knowledge of most others and causing you to likely vote based on who was able to reach you which is dumb.
	
	WORKING PROCESS</h2>
	
<h4><em>With all of the reasons above, I beleive that despite all of the internets negative affects on politics that modern day democracy would suffer a great fall without it.
	I also think that the internet and E-democracy says alot about humanity and serves as an analogy of society itself. Both E-democracy, democracy, the internet and everything on it
	was created by humans, everything bad you see on the internet was done by a fellow human, the internet is not something we can blame, so just as much as we harm and exploit each other,
	at the end of the day we also depend on each other, just like how modern day society and modern day democracy depends on the internet.</em></h4><br>
