<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>Politics and the internet are being integrated closer and closer together every decade. Today's society mainly revolves around information, and communication on a 
	very large scale bases. Imagine a string piece of on a cloth. Assume that each string is a human, before the internet existed, and they can interact with their 
	neighbor only, and same goes for the neighbor. With this, it is difficult to form a large group and act towards the common good, as well as the ease of access for 
	information which mainly relies on the word of mouth and travel-time on foot for some people. Internet brings together all of these people, and in the same
	clothes metaphor, acts as a tangled ball of yarn where everyone has a common neighbor in which information is derived from. 
	
	Internet allows for infromation to efficiently and easily be shared among others, and common trends tend to form. Similar to real life culture, internet formed 
	a culture of it's own to hold up. Some parts of these cultures are known as "memes" and this leads to another side of the internet; meme warfare and how
	certain politicians tend to use such memes in favour of them.
