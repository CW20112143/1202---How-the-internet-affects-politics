<h2>How Internet is Ethically Subjective And Politcal Impact on Easily Accessible Information </h2>

<h4><em>The internet is most famous for spreading information rapidly, storying data, and tracking. Imagine a 
	sign-in sheet, but the touch of a finger, all of a person’s detail is imprinted upon the internet with no 
	option to back-out. The second thing the internet is most famous for is for its ability to connect 
	everyone in the world, no matter the distance, personality, or race, in which most people tend to 
	hide behind anonymity, in a sense, making everyone equal and only valued up to their personal 
	opinion. While some are well known among the internet, most tend to be silent, the majority, and 
	the most unknown.<br><br>
	
	Because of what has been mentioned above, the internet will act to anything in terms of the world, 
	meaning a person in Fiji, if in the right position and a little bit of luck, will change few thousands or 
	millions of opinions around the world. This is similar to how a small ripple in the water will 
	eventually make a giant wave. And similarly, as mentioned, the people who do have the most 
	control on people’s opinions and thoughts would be those which are in a high profile, most of the 
	times are not anonymous, and who have a real-world impact.<br><br>
	
	This is a dangerous mix when we apply this to politics. In the first paragraph, I had mentioned that a 
	person’s details are imprinted upon the internet; this data is collected and sold, and those with the 
	high profile can similarly change the way people think. In the case of political views and how internet 
	now makes up half of the political system, the data is worth more than an individual human being in 
	the same regard. With the data on hand, as the example of Trump’s presidency, India’s corrupted 
	politics, and more political standpoints which circulate around the internet (the select few which 
	make the loudest internet “noise” will up being noticed the most).<br><br>
	
	The opposite, however, is also true. In the recent case of BLM, Palestine and Israeli attacks, and the 
	surge of anti-maskers increasing by the day, this is the evidence of misinformation, and a very 
	accurate representation of what people should care about. As racism and non-compliance to health 
	and safety are of biggest concerns, the internet itself (in its mass amounts of users) will make the 
	most noise and mobilize changes themselves, which also falls under the rule of politics; politics are 
	people, working for the people. If laws and regulations are unjust and aggressive actions from the 
	government against the people are evident, then the people will similarly lash out. As is the case of 
	the BLM protests, and the raid of the US Whitehouse which occurred a year earlier, although the 
	latter was formed around misinformation and uncontrolled aggression. Despite not being the will of 
	the majority opinion, the raid was the aggression of a minority of opinion.<br><br>
	
	Taking the Whitehouse Raid for example, it is also possible for the people to circle around false 
	information and believe the given information. Similar to anti-maskers in the same regard, false 
	information and ideologies can grow just as much as any positive ideology. People, being of many 
	personalities and characters, will often join together for right or wrong reasons, while being 
	individuals themselves, will fight for the same ideal. Historically, it has always been a double-edged 
	sword, where subjectively, people are seen fighting for the wrong reasons and they are fighting for 
	the right people, and vice versa.<br><br>
	
	Personally, I believe that the politics itself has not changed for the many years that it has existed; 
	there will still be war for stupid reasons, stupid actions even though for good reasons, and 
	everything in between. Historically speaking, the driving force of politics in the old ages, assume the 
	Roman Empire, would be the speed of information which is being spread; the faster the messenger, 
	the faster the information is spread, and the word of mouth must be rather quick as well. This does 
	not account to how a lot more information is produced, maybe more than what a messenger can 
	send at one time.<br><br>
	
	Compare this to the current view; there is only one messenger who contains all the information, the 
	internet. There is one place in society where a lot of vital information is produced, politics. And the 
	people who will receive the information and act upon the word of mouth, the people. In the olden 
	time, if one messenger spoke many messages to a few hundred people, the few hundred people can 
	turn to a million quickly. But with the internet, one messenger will speak vast number of messages 
	to millions of people, and the millions of people can turn into a billion with only a few taps on a 
	rectangular magical device.<br><br>
	
	I believe that because of this, all negative or positive impacts of politics is amplified and spread 
	easier. But because there is so much information produced and they are readily accessible and even 
	more can be read at any given point, the interest of one piece of information is short-lived, but the 
	impact is also instantaneous. Take BLM as the example; once a strong and a huge protest against 
	racism, now such a protest has died down long ago, although it’s messages certainly had a 
	refreshened awareness of racism and similarly impacted the politics in this way. Had a similar scale 
	of protests were to happen in the olden times, it would last for a long time, and in rare cases, cause 
	major conflict if its impact continued for too long.<br><br>
	
	The politics is as it always has been, the internet only amplified the impact and shortened the length 
	needed to make changes in a few days or hours. The world is hanging by a thread as it always has 
	been, and internet is acting as a dumbbell balanced delicately on the rope, only the modernization 
	of society is the only thing which has made this thread stronger. Similarly, we aren’t that far away 
	from World War 2, some of its technologies still used today, and some would argue we aren’t far 
	away from World War 3 either, which I would predict will have unprecedented impact on internet, 
	and its information. I believe that internet and information will cause, if not be deeply enrooted to 
	the cause, of World War 3.
