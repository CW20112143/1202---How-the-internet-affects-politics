<h1>How The Internet Affects Politics</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The internet has a crucial role in society currently, and it has been a giant leap in humanity's progress. Because of this, we would also like to explore
	the impacts of internet within politics, as a huge chunk of internet is revolving around politics, and a huge chunk of politics revolving around internet. 
	With this ease of access of information and interconnectivity of the people, we wanted to explore some of the ethical implications of politics within
	groups of people.<br><br>
	This topic is important to society because the modern society heavily relies on internet as almost a common resource everyone should have. Similarly, the 
	modern society had major progress in laws and ways to run the world. The internet's information and connectivity relates to politics like politics relate
	to currency, and as a relatively new invention, we wanted to explore the ethical implications of internet and politics.<p></h5>
